*** MDIWindowManager ***

MDIWindowManager magically converts any MDI application into a
modern tabbed (TDI) application. Windows remain just plain
WinForms windows (WPF is supported too) and do not require any
special or custom code. The forms can live in any library and
the application can be architected with proper
Separation-of-concerns.

Tiling support is built-in and windows can be popped out onto
the Windows desktop.

For an advanced example that displays a complex 3-pane interface
typical in many internal business / corporate applications, click
the View | Advanced MDI Example menu item. The advanced example
also demonstrates WPF support!
